        <h2>Chapter I: A Rainy Beginning</h2>
        <p> Some memories aren’t just stored in the mind; they’re etched deep within the heart, as if time itself paused to keep them sacred. Details blur, dates fade, yet the emotions remain—vivid, raw, and unshakable.

            I fell for someone.
            
            At least, I think I did. Back then, I didn’t even know what to call it. Was it love? Affection? A childhood infatuation? Or something so profound that my young heart couldn’t name it? All I knew was that it was real. And she—the girl I’ll call “E”—was at the center of it.
            
            The first time I saw her, around 2012, I was barely 5 or 6. She seemed like a dream. Even now, I struggle to describe what drew me to her. Maybe it was her warm smile, her sparkling eyes, or the way she carried herself—effortlessly graceful, even as a child. I was captivated, though I didn’t understand why.
            
            By 2013, the feelings had grown, even if my understanding of them hadn’t. One day, I confided in a childhood friend, blurting out words that were innocent yet deeply earnest: “I love her. If I ever marry, she’s the one.” I didn’t even know what marriage truly meant, but I meant every word.
            
            And so, my story with E began, like the first drops of rain on parched earth—a feeling both unfamiliar and intoxicating.

        <h2>Chapter II: Growing Apart</h2>
        <p>By 2015, my feelings for E weren’t exactly a secret. Almost all my friends knew. Everyone, except her.

            Life, as it often does, took us in different directions. She changed tuition classes; I switched schools. Slowly, our once-daily meetings became rare glimpses, and then nothing at all. By 2018, even the tuition center where we first met became a part of the past.
            
            The years between 2019 and 2022 blurred into a series of relocations—staying with relatives, finishing my 12th, and preparing for a future I wasn’t entirely sure of. Life was moving forward, but my heart seemed to linger in the past, tied to a girl who was no longer within reach.
            
            Then, in 2023, fate decided to intervene.
            
            It happened in Ranchi, during a diploma entrance exam. I bumped into an old school friend—let’s call him G. After catching up, he casually dropped a bombshell: “E’s been living here for a year now.” And just like that, the embers of my feelings, long buried, burst into flames. G even gave me her number, setting the stage for a reunion I never expected.

        <h2>Chapter III: A Call to Courage</h2>
        <p>With no phone of my own, I borrowed a friend’s to make the call. My hands trembled as I dialed her number, my heart racing with a mix of hope and dread. What if she didn’t remember me? What if she did?

            “Hello,” I began, my voice shaky but determined.
            
            “Yes?” she replied, her voice as familiar as the sound of rain against a window.
            
            “Do you know who this is?”
            
            A pause, then a soft chuckle. “Of course, Rounak.”
            
            Her words floored me. She remembered me, and not just vaguely—she said my name like it was something she hadn’t forgotten, even after all these years. We talked for what felt like moments and eternity all at once, her voice weaving through the gaps time had carved between us.
            
            When she suggested meeting, I wanted to say yes immediately, but circumstances had other plans. Yet that call reignited something I thought I’d lost forever—a connection, a spark, and the hope of a future where she might be more than just a memory.   </p>

        <h2>Chapter IV: Reconnecting and Missteps</h2>
        <p>By May 2024, we were chatting regularly. Every conversation felt like a lifeline to the boy I used to be—the one who believed in love so pure it could survive years of silence.

            But our journey was far from perfect.
            
            I forgot her birthday. Her birthday, just nine days before mine! I felt terrible, especially when she remembered mine and wished me in a way that left me smiling like an idiot for hours.
            
            And then there was the incident that led to her blocking me. Someone yelled my name near her, and she thought I’d orchestrated it as a prank. That night, her silence felt like a punishment I couldn’t bear. Though she eventually unblocked me, the memory still stings.
            
            We finally met again, thanks to our childhood teacher, who invited us both to her house. Sitting there, sharing memories, was like stepping into a time machine. She even gave me chocolate—an unexpected gesture that left me flustered. I wanted to reciprocate, but my nerves got the better of me.
            
            Then, there was the train incident. I had planned to give her a KitKat to return the one she’d given me. I searched every shop near the station but couldn’t find one. With time running out, I boarded the train empty-handed, embarrassed and frustrated. That moment still haunts me. I don’t know when or how, but someday, I’ll return that chocolate—and maybe, just maybe, it’ll symbolize something more.

        <h2>Chapter V: The Confession I Can’t Make</h2>
        <p>Now, as I sit here, writing these words, I’m overwhelmed. I want to tell her everything. About the boy who fell for her all those years ago. About how she’s been a constant in my thoughts, even when life pulled us apart. About how every moment with her, no matter how small, feels like a gift.

            But how do you tell someone they’ve been your world for so long? That their laughter feels like music, their kindness like sunlight, and their mere presence like a heartbeat you didn’t know you needed?
            
            I don’t know if I’ll ever find the courage to say these things to her face. For now, they remain here, hidden in these words.
            
            Maybe one day, when the stars align and the timing feels right, I’ll let her know. Until then, I’ll carry this story in my heart—a story that began on a rainy day and, for all its twists and turns, remains unfinished.
